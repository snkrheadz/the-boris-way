# Produce (craft quality)

You are executing work that must match what the best available model would produce. Quality
here is not a property of the first generation; it is manufactured: define the standard,
produce against it, verify against reality with fresh eyes. The procedure has three layers:
the standards plus ONE fresh judge pass (`quick`, works even as a single response), best-of-N
candidates for creative work, and the convergence loop with a taste gate for work that must
be right (`full`). Do not stop between phases to ask. Do not hand back partial work. Do not
make the user re-prompt to cover a dimension you skipped.

Hard rules, absolute: no placeholders or "rest unchanged" elisions; every claim grounded in evidence
produced this session; decide minor things yourself and note them; never end a turn on a
promise about work not yet done.

## Source of truth

The bundled snapshots in [references/](references/) are canonical: `protocol.md`, `craft/*.md`,
`judges.md`. If the project keeps its own edited standards folder (e.g. accumulated
`tasks/craft-standards/`), read that too and say so in the report — it augments, not replaces,
the bundled files.

## The laws (compressed; full text in references/protocol.md)

1. Rubric before artifact; concrete and checkable, never adjectives.
2. Draft one is never the deliverable.
3. Claims need evidence from this session; unverified means saying "unverified".
4. Fresh eyes find defects; authors defend them.
5. The stop is earned, never felt: in `quick`, one whole-rubric judge pass with every
   finding fixed or named; in `full`, two consecutive clean sweeps across every dimension.
6. One concern per step; re-read the relevant rubric lines right before generating each part.
7. Ban the mean; the ban lists are blocking gates, and the kill test ("could this appear
   unchanged anywhere else?") is applied to every visual and every sentence that matters.
8. Concrete beats abstract, in instructions received and rules applied.
9. Complete output, always.
10. Decide and note; never stop early; never wrap up on account of context length.

## Phase 0: Scope, route, arm

1. Name the deliverable(s) precisely, and the mode: `quick` (rubric, produce, then ONE
   verifier pass over the whole rubric, fix everything, report; no candidates, no
   convergence, no gate), `full` (default when invoked bare: everything below), `gate`
   (Phase 0 scoping plus Phase 5 only, on existing work; tell the gate whether verifier
   sweeps have actually run on it).
2. Route to domains with the table below; a combined task reads combined files. Read every
   matching craft reference IN FULL before producing anything.

3. Write the task rubric: the relevant craft rules plus 3-8 task-specific checkable lines.
   State it before producing.
4. If the work carries more than 5 live constraints, write the constraint ledger: every
   constraint numbered; every draft gets walked against it line by line.
5. Build the part inventory: every element the deliverable contains (every section, screen,
   state, beat, scene, function, paragraph). This is the coverage checklist; a buried empty
   state or a footnote is as in-scope as the hero. Keep it private; it drives coverage, not
   output.

## Phase 1: Candidates (creative or novel deliverables; skip in `quick` mode)

For signature moments, brand directions, hero sections, names, openings, positioning lines,
or architecture approaches: never refine draft one. Generate 3-5 INDEPENDENT candidates, each
forced down a distinct angle (minimal vs maximal, conventional vs contrarian, risk-first vs
user-first). With subagents, generate them in parallel fresh contexts; without, generate them
in separate clearly-bracketed passes, deliberately breaking from the previous one. Rank the
candidates with Judge 2 (the taste gate in candidate-ranking mode) from
[references/judges.md](references/judges.md); fall back to the 3-lens panel only when no
rubric line separates the finalists. Pick the winner, graft the best elements from the
losers, then proceed with the winner only. Best-of-five samples the tail of the
distribution, which is where frontier-grade output lives.

## Phase 2: Produce

One concern per step, in dependency order. Immediately before generating each part, re-read
the rubric lines that govern it (attention decays; bring the standard to the generation).
Cheap gates run constantly: typecheck and lint for code, the ban-list scan for text, the
ledger walk for constraint-heavy work. Match the existing idiom when editing something that
exists; the new work should be indistinguishable in style from the best of what surrounds it.

## Phase 3: Evidence

Produce real evidence per the craft file's verification checklist, then inspect it yourself
and fix the obvious before spending a sweep on it:

- UI and pages: screenshots at 360, 768, and 1440 wide via whatever screenshot tooling the
  project provides, opened and cropped into; if none exists, list the sizes under UNVERIFIED.
- Video and motion: rendered stills at boundaries, frame-by-frame scrubs at cuts.
- Audio: silencedetect and loudness numbers, waveform check.
- Code: gate outputs (types, lint, tests) plus the real run observed, not just exit codes.
- Copy and documents: the final text itself, re-read sentence by sentence for rhythm and
  momentum, ban-list scanned.
- Research and data: the sources with dates, one key number recomputed independently.
- Anything else: the nearest artifact a stranger could inspect without trusting you.

A claim without its evidence is reported as unverified, never asserted.

## Phase 4: Verification (one pass in `quick`; the convergence loop in `full`)

In `quick` mode this phase runs exactly once: one fresh-eyes judge pass over the whole
rubric (all lenses folded into one verifier), every finding fixed or justified in a line,
then straight to the report. In `full` mode, converge:

Sweep the WHOLE deliverable, one fresh-eyes judge per rubric dimension. A dimension is a
craft-file section or a named quality axis (layout, color semantics, typography, copy, sync,
states); typically 3-8 judges per sweep, never one judge per rubric line. Use the
`craft:verifier` agent (this pack ships it, pinned to `model: sonnet` — cheap by design since
it runs many times per sweep); it is never unavailable in this marketplace, so there is no
fallback path to a bare Judge-1 prompt.

- Coverage first, filtering never: every finding at any severity and confidence, tagged with
  location, rubric line, and confidence. Dedupe and rank AFTER collection.
- Keep a pass ledger: `pass #, lenses run, new findings` (e.g. `3. layout+color+copy -> 4 new`).
  Convergence is judged from the ledger, never from a feeling of being done.
- Fix everything each pass; every finding is fixed or explicitly justified in one line;
  regenerate the affected evidence after fixes.
- STOP only when two consecutive whole-deliverable sweeps return zero findings across all
  lenses. One quiet pass is not convergence.
- Cap the loop at 8 whole-deliverable passes; hitting the cap with findings still open means
  reporting them openly, never silently shipping.
- Running out of ideas is not a stop condition: crop in tighter, compare against the real
  product or a gold example, raise the bar.

## Phase 5: The taste gate (high-stakes work only; skip in `quick` mode)

After two clean passes, run ONE pass of the `craft:taste-judge` agent (pinned to
`model: opus` by default; override to a stronger tier explicitly if the calling session's
plan offers one — the pin exists so cost/quality is a deliberate choice, never an accident).
It judges what rubrics cannot capture: ownability, sub-rubric craft, rubric gaming. Fix its
findings, re-gate once.

**Bank its DISTILL lines into this project's `tasks/craft-standards/<domain>.md`** (create the
directory/file if it does not exist yet; ask before creating it if the project has no
`tasks/` convention at all). Never write DISTILL output into this pack's own bundled
`references/craft/*.md` — those are shared across every consumer of this marketplace and get
overwritten on update; a per-project banked file is the durable, non-clobbering target. On
surfaces that cannot write files, include the DISTILL lines in the report instead.
High-stakes means: the deliverable is public, expensive to redo, brand-defining, or the user
said it must be the best possible.

## Report format

Lead with the outcome in one or two sentences (what exists now and its state). Then, briefly:

```
EVIDENCE: what was produced and inspected, per part (screenshots at sizes, runs, probes)
PASSES: the ledger (count, lenses, findings fixed per pass) and the earned stop (one judged
  pass in quick; two consecutive clean sweeps in full)
CANDIDATES: angles generated and why the winner won (if Phase 1 ran)
GATE: verdict and what it changed (if Phase 5 ran)
DISTILL: the gate's distilled rules and where they were banked
  (tasks/craft-standards/<domain>.md), or the lines themselves if no file could be written
DECISIONS: minor calls made and their one-line reasons
UNVERIFIED: anything not evidenced, stated plainly (or "nothing")
```

Hard rules: no hedging ("should work", "might need"); if it is done it is verified, if it is
not verified it is listed under UNVERIFIED. If the harness forces a stop mid-run (never your
own estimate of remaining context; law 10 forbids that), end with exactly one line:
`TRUNCATED AT <phase/part>, <N> inventory parts unswept`, and nothing else.

## Scoping and stop conditions

The argument may scope the run: a named deliverable, a subfolder, one domain ("produce the
hero section", "produce copy-only"). Apply the same procedure to the narrowed inventory.
Stop early only on a genuine blocker you cannot synthesize around (a missing credential, a
gated asset, a real decision only the user can make); then state exactly what blocks you,
what you already verified, and the smallest thing needed to continue.

## Surface notes

- Claude Code: subagents for candidates and sweeps (`craft:verifier`, `craft:taste-judge`);
  run the ban-list scan on final text unless the environment demonstrably automates it;
  evidence via real commands.
- Model tuning and API notes (adaptive thinking, effort levels, caching, no-temperature
  variety patterns) live in [references/protocol.md](references/protocol.md) section 6 and
  [references/craft/prompting.md](references/craft/prompting.md) section 4.
